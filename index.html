        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt the differet types of website developers, such as frontend developers, who codes the 
            design of the website which users see and interact with, backend developers, who works behind the
            scenes to build and maintain the technology needed to power the frontend and full stack developers,
            who do both frontend and backend. I learnt how HTML, CSS and Javascript help to power the frontend
            of the website, HTML helps define the layout of the website, CSS helps to style the website and 
            Javascript helps to add functionality to the website. I have learnt the structure of a standard 
            HTML file and the different commonly used HTML tags such as p, br, em, h1, h2, li, etc.. I have
            made a recipe card using the different HTML elements that I have learnt.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 2</h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt the the purpose of HTML semantics which is the syntax for HTML. Although there is no 
            difference in output for semantic and non-semantic elements, the semantics help to provide meaning
            to a HTML page to make it more understandable by stating clearly the different sections and layout
            of websites. I learnt the common HTML semantics used - nav, article, section, div, form, etc.. 
            Additionally, I have also learnt the basics of CSS - color, background-color, style, font-size, etc..
            I have learnt how to link a separate CSS file to my HTML file. I have also learnt how to use classes 
            and IDs - classes is to group styles together so that to use these styles over and over again, only 
            the class has to be called so that the HTML code will be cleaner and neater instead of having to type 
            the same lines over and over again which will make the HTML code messy and IDs is the same as classes 
            except that it is unique so the group of code can only be called once. Additionally, I learnt how to 
            use google fonts to import fonts so that I would have more font choices to use. I have also done the 
            CAs to familiarise myself with semantics and CSS styling.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 3</h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt about HTML forms and how to write them using input and label tags. I have learnt how to 
            validate my form to ensure that certain input types, such as emails and passwords are in the correct
            format, if not the browser would not accept it and show an error. I have also learnt about the CSS
            document object model (DOM) and how to style elements with the DOM. I have also learnt about media 
            queries and how to use them to make a website look good on different devices such as mobile, laptop
            and desktop. I have also learnt about the three different types of positioning - absolute, relative 
            and fixed and how to use them to better position elements in my webpage. I have learnt about Z-index,
            which is the transparency and flexboxes to group items together and display them vertically or
            horizontally. Last but not least, I learnt that wireframing is just a blueprint for how the website is
            going to look like. By doing the CAs, I have written a simple validation form and practised positioning 
            and flexboxes.

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 4</h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt how to use responsive images for flexible layouts and the purpose of doing so - auto-resize
            based on screen size and better design control depending on device. I have also further familiarised with
            responsive images and flexboxes by doing the CA. Last but not least, I followed the steps to create a 
            repository for my assignment 1.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 5</h2>
        <p>
            Through a series of videos in LinkedIn, I have learnt about Javascript, such as the document object model 
            (DOM) and how to make use of the DOM (which works the same way as CSS DOM) to access elements to change 
            their attributes. I have learnt how to write simple commands in the console in the browser to immediately
            access their properties instead of having to search the HTML code for it all the time. I have learnt 
            various methods which can return elements to modify them, such as getElementsByClassName, getElementById, 
            querySelectorAll etc..
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 6</h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt the basics and syntax of Javascript, such as variables, functions, classes, etc. and how to 
            use them to create objects, modify attributes, etc.. I have also learnt more about the DOM in Javascript
            and how to use it to view or modify attributes for certain elements. The CAs that I have done in week 6 
            have helped me to better familiarise myself with the basics of Javascript as it is still a new language 
            to me.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 7</h2>
        <p>
            I have learnt about event handling to allow users to better interact with the webpage through the use of
            Javascript. I learnt about UI events, keyboard events, mouse events, focus events and form events. I have
            also learnt about event listeners which is to wait for a user to to interact with the webpage before
            executing the code whenever that happens. I also learnt about event objects, which tell information
            about the event and the element it happened upon. I have also learnt about forms and validation to
            prevent users from entering invalid inputs. I have learnt about client and server validation. I have
            also learnt about focus and blur and various form features such as textboxes, radio buttons, checkbox,
            and dropdown menu. I have also learnt about JSON which is a file format for storing and transporting
            data.
