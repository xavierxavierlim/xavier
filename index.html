            I have learnt the differet types of website developers, such as frontend developers, who codes the 
            design of the website which users see and interact with, backend developers, who works behind the
            scenes to build and maintain the technology needed to power the frontend and full stack developers,
            who do both frontend and backend. I learnt how HTML, CSS and Javascript help to power the frontend
            of the website, HTML helps define the layout of the website, CSS helps to style the website and 
            Javascript helps to add functionality to the website. I have learnt the structure of a standard 
            HTML file and the different commonly used HTML tags such as p, br, em, h1, h2, li, etc.. I have
            made a recipe card using the different HTML elements that I have learnt.

            I have learnt the the purpose of HTML semantics which is the syntax for HTML. Although there is no 
            difference in output for semantic and non-semantic elements, the semantics help to provide meaning
            to a HTML page to make it more understandable by stating clearly the different sections and layout
            of websites. I learnt the common HTML semantics used - nav, article, section, div, form, etc.. 
            Additionally, I have also learnt the basics of CSS - color, background-color, style, font-size, etc..
            I have learnt how to link a separate CSS file to my HTML file. I have also learnt how to use classes 
            and IDs - classes is to group styles together so that to use these styles over and over again, only 
            the class has to be called so that the HTML code will be cleaner and neater instead of having to type 
            the same lines over and over again which will make the HTML code messy and IDs is the same as classes 
            except that it is unique so the group of code can only be called once. Additionally, I learnt how to 
            use google fonts to import fonts so that I would have more font choices to use. I have also done the 
            CAs to familiarise myself with semantics and CSS styling.
