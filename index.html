        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>
            I have learnt the differet types of website developers, such as frontend developers, who codes the 
            design of the website which users see and interact with, backend developers, who works behind the
            scenes to build and maintain the technology needed to power the frontend and full stack developers,
            who do both frontend and backend. I learnt how HTML, CSS and Javascript help to power the frontend
            of the website, HTML helps define the layout of the website, CSS helps to style the website and 
            Javascript helps to add functionality to the website. I have learnt the structure of a standard 
            HTML file and the different commonly used HTML tags such as p, br, em, h1, h2, li, etc.. I have
            made a recipe card using the different HTML elements that I have learnt.
